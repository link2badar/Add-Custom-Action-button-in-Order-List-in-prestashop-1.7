There are few steps through which we can acheive how to add custom action button in the order listing table in prestashop 1.7
Remember: this is only valid for order listing table. but for product listing/ category listing - procedure is the same. just filename will change. 

Step 1: Open file ProjectName/src/Core/Grid/Definition/Factory/OrderGridDefinitionFactory.php
Scroll to the bottom and add the following code

 ->add((new LinkRowAction('download_xml'))
  ->setName($this->trans('Download Xml', [], 'Admin.Actions'))
  ->setIcon('download')
  ->setOptions([
    'route' => 'admin_orders_download_xml',
    'route_param_name' => 'orderId',
    'route_param_field' => 'id_order',
    'use_inline_display' => true,
    'clickable_row' => true,
  ])
)


Route: You can add route as you desired but 'admin_orders' is prefix. So this must be enter.


Step2:
Now this route require url to define somewhere. So whenver this button will hit, 
Require url will redirect.
Open the file ProjectName/src/PrestaShopBundle/Resources/config/routing/admin/sell/orders/orders.yml

Add below code near the 50, 52 line number.
admin_orders_download_xml:
  path: /{orderId}/download-xml
  methods: [GET]
  defaults:
    _controller: PrestaShopBundle:Admin/Sell/Order/Order:downloadXml
    _legacy_controller: AdminOrders
  requirements:
    orderId: \d+

admin_orders_download_xml : main heading is the same route which is defined in step 1
path :  will be dynamic or your choic
_controller : its the controller name and function name. order:downloadXml (order represent controll, downloadXml is function name)


Step3:
Now we have set up the route, now function require to addd.
function need to add in ordercontroller named with downloadXmlAction
public function downloadXmlAction($orderId)
    {
      // anything you want
    }

Action is postfix which must be enter. 

Step4:
admin panel/advanced parameters/performance/ clear your cache.

done.
